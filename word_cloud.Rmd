```{r cars}
# folder with PDF of confirmation hearings 

dest <- "C:\\Users\\Desktop\\supreme"

file <- system.file(file.path("doc", "Sweave.pdf"), package = "utils")

myfiles <- pdf_text(dest)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
